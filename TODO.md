# Short-Term TODO:
- Fix the input stuff 
- Make the resources as pointers not just copies
- Better shader info like having it's path embeded and reading from a single file instead of 2 or more

- Batch renderer
- Design an instanced renderer?!!!
- Materials

# Things to fix or make better 
- is_key_pressed needs to be fixed as it is identical to is_key_down
- Texture numbers. Needs to be set automatically not by the client
- Uniform buffers starting size and automatic configurations of the layout just like the pointer attributes
- Vertex arrays. Just everything. Refactor everything in it
- Probably have begin_renderer a scene object or something like that instead of render_data

# Mid-Term TODO:
- Slowly remove STL from the engine. Completely!
- More sophisticated memory profiler
- File logging
- Cross platform console logging
- Documentation
- Scenes
- Entities
- Serialization
- Audio system -> Basic at first then something more sophisticated

# Long-Term TODO:
- GUI -> Editor gui and game gui
- Scripting system -> Native and external
- Physics
- Particles -> gpu-based and cpu-based
